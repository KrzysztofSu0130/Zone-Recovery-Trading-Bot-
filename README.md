# Strategy and Restriction
This strategy compose with four horizontal lines from top to bottom: Top Exit, Buy Line, Sell Line, Bottom Exit.
Assume the distance from the Buy Line to the Sell Line is x; then the distance to Top Exit is 2x, and to Bottom Exit is 3x.

- First, place a buy order on market price of x units and the price will be the Buy Line.
- If price hits Top Exit then exit.

<br/>
<br/>
  
- If price hits the Sell Line then open a sell of 2x.
- If price hits Bottom Exit then close all positions (since the sell is twice the size of the buy, the sell can cover the loss of buy order).

<br/>
<br/>

- Similarly, if price returns to the (Buy Line/Sell Line), will triger a (buy/sell) order thatâ€™s double the size of the previous. Continue the cycle until price hits the Exit line, then close all positions.  
- Continue alternating (doubling each time) until an exit line is reached, at which point close everything.

# Restriction
- Due to limited capital, there'll bee a maximum number of entries.
    - Once that max is reached, no further orders will be placed.
    - It might cause a loss if price moves against the final entry.
<br/>

- No weekend trading since liquidity and volume are lower.
